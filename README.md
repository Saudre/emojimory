## Overview

Emojimory is a memory game written in vanilla javascript. The main goal of the game is to find the 32 pairs of emojis with the less number of attempts.

You can play the game on my website [here](https://saudre.com/work/games/emojimory/).

Currently, I am writing a blog post explaining my development process and design decisions. Once I finish the post, I will share a link here to it. 

Meanwhile, keep in mind that this is the first game I have developed, and, at that moment, when I was writing the code for the game, my main goal was to use the concepts of classes and OOP. Please get in touch with me if you have any comments or recommendations; I would appreciate your feedback.
